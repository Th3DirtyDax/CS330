# CS330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization


# How do I approach designing software?
  I typically try to approach software design by reading and understanding the instructions and requirements of the task given. Then I try to plan out how I would like the project to go and figure out what steps I will need to take to reach my goal. Once I begin I typically start small and work my way out to the larger scale task. I try to break things apart and implement areas as I develop and as they are needed. 
#  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      Being more organized in my code has been a development from this course. As this was probably the largest project I have had in the degree thus far. It forced me to further compartmentalize areas of the code to make them easier to navigate and find. 
#  What design process did you follow for your project work?
      The process used mostly followed the coursework requirements and the OpenGL guidance. As the weeks progressed and I needed to implement new parts to meet the requirements. However, the design process was to try and consolidate sections of the code to be more useful. The shapes.h file was designed to keep all of the vertices and elements for the shapes used while allowing the use of multiple objects numerous times without the need to create further code. 
#  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    Tactics used in this project could apply to all of my future coursework primarily in the organizational skills developed throughout this course. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
  My approach to developing programs is much like that of the designing process. I try to break down the project and gain an understanding of what I need to accomplish. Once I have that, I can begin to figure out the structure, how I will develop the program, and how it will be organized. I try to constantly test the program and ensure that the new additions made will function properly as I go. 
#  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      
#  How did iteration factor into your development?
#  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
#   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
