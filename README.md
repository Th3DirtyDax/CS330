# CS330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization


# How do I approach designing software?
  I typically try to approach software design by reading and understanding the instructions and requirements of the task given. 
  Then I try to plan out how I would like the project to go and figure out what steps I will need to take to reach my goal. 
  Once I begin I typically start small and work my way out to the larger scale task. 
  I try to break things apart and implement areas as I develop and as they are needed. 
  
#  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
      Being more organized in my code has been a development from this course. 
      As this was probably the largest project I have had in the degree thus far. 
      It forced me to further compartmentalize areas of the code to make them easier to navigate and find. 
      
#  What design process did you follow for your project work?
      The process used mostly followed the coursework requirements and the OpenGL guidance. 
      As the weeks progressed and I needed to implement new parts to meet the requirements. 
      However, the design process was to try and consolidate sections of the code to be more useful. 
      The shapes.h file was designed to keep all of the vertices and elements for the shapes used 
      while allowing the use of multiple objects numerous times without the need to create further code. 
      
#  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    Tactics used in this project could apply to all of my future coursework primarily in the 
    organizational skills developed throughout this course. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
  My approach to developing programs is much like that of the designing process. 
  I try to break down the project and gain an understanding of what I need to accomplish. 
  Once I have that, I can begin to figure out the structure, how I will develop the program, 
  and how it will be organized. I try to constantly test the program and ensure that 
  the new additions made will function properly as I go. 
  
#  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      Some new strategies that I used were primarily dividing the code out into many different files. 
      While I normally have to have multiple .cpp/.h files in projects, this time I separated 
      some portions out that I may not have previously done before. Previously I would have
      put most of the code for the objects in one file versus multiple files. In the beginning 
      I kept all code pertaining to the shapes in one file and that presented issues causing me to 
      do many trial errors until I tried to separate the shapes completely from everything else, then
      creating files for each specific object. 
      
#  How did iteration factor into your development?
    I had to continuously test the code as I implemented new portions or objects into the scene.
    While creating the window I had to test the code to ensure that the window would populate,
    then the same applied to each time I created new code throughout the project. Each time I 
    needed to create an all-new shape with vertices I haven't used yet, I would have to test the 
    code to ensure that the new objects formed correctly. This principle applied to every 
    portion of the code as new things were added or objects were shifted around the 3D scene.
    
#  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    I had to think more and take steps back when there was an issue. I had much trial and error throughout this project
    that required me to constantly revisit steps or materials from the lessons. This project demanded more thinking
    and processing on various ways to make the code do what I wanted it to do. I developed new ideas for attempting the
    successful completion of the code. However, they may have failed in this project but those ideas may be useful in
    other projects or assignments I attempt to complete in the future. 
    
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    I really had only a few amounts of goals when I enrolled in computer science. The primary was the development 
    of my own small video game just for fun. While that may not be a primary focus of computer science and SNHU 
    would offer better degrees for that path, I did not want to feel limited to just game development and hoped for a broader range
    of options. Computer science also opens the doors for me to seek employment anywhere in the world and that was a big factor for
    me and how I would progress in my life. I had not given too much thought to professional goals in computer science but I will discover them 
    as I move forward. 

#   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    The specific subject of how this course will aid my future educational pathway is still very unclear to me. I do not quite know how it will be implemented
    in future courses I take or how the knowledge of OpenGL will play into effect. As I have covered previously on the indirect knowledge learned in coding as a whole, 
    I hope that will be beneficial moving forward. 

#   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    As I have not decided on a clear pathway professionally, I also honestly cannot say how or where this course will and knowledge will be applied
    in my professional goals as well.
