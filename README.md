# CS330 - Computational Graphics and Visualization


# How do I approach designing software?
  I typically try to approach software design by reading and understanding the instructions and requirements of the task given. Then I try to plan out how I would like the project to go and figure out what steps I will need to take to reach my goal. Once I begin I typically start small and work my way out to the larger scale task. 
#  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
#  What design process did you follow for your project work?
#  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

# How do I approach developing programs?
#  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
#  How did iteration factor into your development?
#  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
#   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
